# Styles

This project template is setup to use (http://sass-lang.com/)[SCSS]. The folder structure has been broken up to match the templates and (https://github.com/fellswoop/wiki/wiki/Atomic-Design)[Fell Swoop's approach on atomic design]. Editing of `/elements/sprite.scss` directly is pointless. This file is generated by the SCG icons sprite Gulp task.

Use `main.custom.scss` for all project specific references. Use `main.vendor.scss` for all 3rd party libraries and plugins.
