# Styles

This project template is setup to use [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/). The folder structure has been broken up to match the templates.

Use `main.custom.scss` for all project specific references. Use `main.vendor.scss` for all 3rd party libraries and plugins.

## Generated Files

`/elements/sprite.scss` is generated by the icons Gulp task. If modifications are necessary, you must edit `gulp/icons/sprite.scss`
