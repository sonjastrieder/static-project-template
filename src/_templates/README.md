# Templates

The folder structure has been broken up to match [Fell Swoop's approach on atomic design](https://github.com/fellswoop/wiki/wiki/Atomic-Design).

All non-global templates should be constructed using the `/components/example.pug` mixin. The prefix letter matches the initial of the cooresponding folder and serves as a helpful identifier. By using this pattern the data files are able to use a dynamic approach of including templates. The context object passed into the mixins allows for variable amounts of data.

There are two files which should not be edited directly:

`/utilities/_includes.pug` is updated automatically to include all components, elements and groups. This is the basis of the usage of dynamic mixins and means you do not need to manually add includes in order to use mixins within templates.

`/sprite.svg` is generated by the SVG icons Gulp task and is included into `/layouts/_base.pug`.
